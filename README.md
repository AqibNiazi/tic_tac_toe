# 🎯 Tic-Tac-Toe with React

A **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built with React, focusing on core React concepts such as state management, derived states, and component-based architecture.

## 🚀 Features
- 🏆 **Two-Player Game:** Players take turns marking the grid.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Game Board:** Updates based on player moves.
- 🏁 **Win Detection:** Determines the winner based on predefined winning combinations.

## 📚 Concepts Practiced
- 🎯 **Lifting State Up** – Managed shared state across components.
- 🔍 **Derived State** – Computed values like active player and winner without redundant state.
- 🎛 **Multiple State Values** – Used separate state variables for players, game turns, and UI updates.
- ⚛️ **Component vs. Normal Functions** – Structured logic cleanly between components and utility functions.
- 📦 **Arrays & Objects in State** – Managed game turns, board state, and player data effectively.
- 📋 **Nested Lists** – Rendered dynamic game board and turn logs efficiently.
